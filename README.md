                  STM32 CAN Communication Project
                  
         üìù Project Overview
         This project showcases the implementation of CAN (Controller Area Network) communication using an STM32 microcontroller to interact with external devices. The project involves setting up the CAN peripheral, configuring GPIOs for LED control, and processing received CAN messages to trigger specific actions, such as toggling LEDs.

         üîß Key Features
         CAN1 Peripheral Configuration: Set up the CAN1 interface on the STM32 microcontroller for message transmission and reception.
         Message Filtering: Apply filters to process only specific CAN messages based on their identifiers.
         LED Control via GPIOD: Manage the state of LEDs connected to the GPIOD port based on the received CAN data.
