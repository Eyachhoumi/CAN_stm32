         STM32 CAN Communication Project

    This project demonstrates how to use CAN (Controller Area Network) communication between an STM32 microcontroller and external devices. The project includes configuration of the CAN peripheral, GPIOs for LED control, and the handling of received CAN messages to perform specific actions such as turning LEDs on or off.

     Project Overview
    This project configures the CAN1 peripheral on an STM32 microcontroller to:
    - Transmit and receive CAN messages.
    - Filter received messages based on their identifiers.
    - Control LEDs on the GPIOD port based on the received data.
